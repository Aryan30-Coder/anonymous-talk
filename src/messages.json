    "content": "Your work ethic and clarity of thought stand out even from a distance. The way you communicate ideas feels structured, respectful, and genuinely insightful, which makes you seem both capable and approachable. People like you tend to create calm, productive environments wherever you go. I’m curious — how do you usually organize your time when you’re juggling multiple responsibilities? Do you rely on strict schedules, or do you prefer a more flexible approach? Also, what skill or habit do you think has contributed the most to your growth so far?",

    "content": "I don’t know you personally, but something about your vibe is really captivating. You have that rare mix of confidence and kindness that makes people want to know you better. There’s a warmth in how you present yourself that feels magnetic, almost impossible to ignore. If I could describe you in one word, it would be “intriguing.” So tell me — if we ever met in real life, what kind of place would you choose for a perfect conversation: a cozy café, a scenic walk, or a rooftop at sunset?",

    "content": "You seem like the kind of person who could accidentally become the main character of a sitcom just by walking into a room. Your personality gives “unintentional legend” energy — the type who says something totally normal but somehow makes everyone laugh. I bet you’ve had at least one hilarious misunderstanding in your life. So spill it: what’s the funniest thing that ever happened to you in public? Bonus points if it involved food, awkward small talk, or a very dramatic overreaction!",
